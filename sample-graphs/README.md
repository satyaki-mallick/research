# SourceCred Sample Graphs

This directory contains sample graphs for research purposes, along with a utility for updating them.
Each file is the cred graph for a particular repository, named as OWNER_REPO.json.

To update the graphs with the latest data from GitHub, just run `./update.sh`. It may take a few minutes.
