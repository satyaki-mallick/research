# SourceCred Sample Graphs

This repository contains sample SourceCred graph JSON for the following repositories:
- [sourcecred/sourcecred](https://github.com/sourcecred/sourcecred)
- [sourcecred/research](https://github.com/sourcecred/research)

The JSON format is declared [here][json-format]. Basically, at the top level, it contains two elements.
The first is a compatibility frame which declares the data type ("sourcecred/graph") and the
version ("0.4.0" at time of writing). The second element is the actual graph JSON.

[json-format]: https://github.com/sourcecred/sourcecred/blob/8772daa8b82a3cea3f073bad4f5060e78e802e25/src/core/graph.js#L146

The graph JSON is divided into two parts: nodes and edges. Nodes is an array of addresses,
where each address is represented as an array of strings. You can read more about address
semantics [here][../algorithm.md]. The nodes array is lexically sorted by address.

Edges is an array of objects containing a `address`, `srcIndex`, and `dstIndex`.
The address is an array of strings, like with the node addresses.
`srcIndex` is the sorted index of the source address, and `dstIndex` is the
sorted index of the destination address. (This representation is more space-efficient
than including the full src and dst address.)

These graphs were generated by using a yet-unpublished SourceCred CLI command.
Once the graph generation command is merged, this document will be updated with
instructions for regenerating the graphs.
